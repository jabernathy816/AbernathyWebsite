    I have had an extensive work history and it all isn't related to Information Technology.
    One of my first jobs in omaha was a pizza guy! I loved this job for the comradery, how
    it taught me work ethic and the skills of relating to my bosses. My second job out of this
    was working as a systems support manager and assistant technical director at a local
    church. After about 4 years of IT support and a little burnout, i decided to try my hand
    at corporate and go for an internship at Union Pacific! After about two years of that I
    am working for a private company now, doing IT support and systems management at a local
    doctors office.

    My aspirations for further development is that I would really like to try my hand at
    development, whatever that entails. I am excited to learn python, and am already experience
    in java, css, and html. I would love to do a full DOM system in this class, learning how
    to make an entire website talk and function properly. I hope to be good at it so that I can
    get a dev position after the current job I am at.
