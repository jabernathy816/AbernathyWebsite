<p>I love hanging out with people and getting to know new people. I like to think I have a knack for getting people
    to open up and genuinely learning more about them. I
    love to play music, to watch drum videos and highlights on youtube, and learn more from
    this new self-improvement movement that's going on. If I'm not doing something productive you'll probably
    catch me watching the office or parks and rec. Brilliant comedies in my opinion.

    As I get older I am seeing that family is more and more important. I am also seeing how deep relationships create a lasting
    life when things get tumultuous and tiresome. People are the main reason I joined MIS in the first place. I am heavily involved
    in the community, my local church, and the growth of others around me. I like to think that people are a fantastic hobby for me.
