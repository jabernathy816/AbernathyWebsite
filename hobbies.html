    Hobbies
</p>

<p1>I love hanging out with people and getting to know new people. I like to think I have a knack for getting people to open up and genuinely learning more about them. I
    love to play music, to watch drum videos and highlights on youtube, and learn more from
    this new self-improvement mix. If I'm not doing something productive you'll probably
    catch me watching the office or parks and rec. Brilliant comedies imo.
