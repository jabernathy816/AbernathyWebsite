My name is Josiah Abernathy, and i'm originally from lawrence kansas. As you can tell my favorite colors are dark shades and bright greens:) I moved to Omaha about 10 years ago
so this is home for sure. I have had a ton of life experience in random events and can relate to almost anyone. I enjoy people
and love learning new things about others. I am consistently blown away by new things that happen on a daily basis.
